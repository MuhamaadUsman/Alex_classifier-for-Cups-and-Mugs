The classifier uses the popular AlexNet architecture, which is a deep convolutional neural network known for its ability to perform well on image classification tasks. By feeding the Mug and Cup Image Classification Dataset into AlexNet, the classifier can learn to recognize the features that distinguish mugs from cups, such as their shape, color, and handle.

With the trained classifier, it is possible to classify new images of mugs and cups with a high degree of accuracy. This can be useful for a variety of applications, such as automatically sorting mugs and cups in a manufacturing setting, or for organizing images in a database or photo collection.
